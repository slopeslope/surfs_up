The key difference in weather in June and December is the volatility of precipitation. In June, the rain falls more consistently whereas in December the weather is a more volatile and rains more when it actually rains. 
I would recommend three ways to make this data better. The first is to analyze data on tides and size of waves. The second is the analyze the amount of people who actually surf vs the people who eat ice cream and lastly, the popularity of both surfing and ice cream of each island to have a better understanding of the overall make up.
